<h2>
building blocks for building games
</h2>

--some of the basic building blocks that are used through-out the entire project:
- the canvaas element, to render shapes and images.
- the audio element, to add sounds and the background music.
- the image element, to load our game artwork and display it on the canvas.
- the browser time functions, and game loops to handle animation.
